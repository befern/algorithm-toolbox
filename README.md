# Algorithm Toolbox

Following the excercises of Coursera's Algorithm Toolbox course (by University of California, San Diego & National
Research University Higher School of Economics), this project contains solutions for the assigments, but as a library
instead of the format expected by the course.

Tests cover questions as well as major corner cases

## Greedy Algorithms

### Give change with the minimum amount of coins
### The problem of the fractional Knapsack
### Maximize dot product of 2 lists
### Given a set of segments, the minimum amount of points so all segments contain at leat one point
### Given an integer, find the longest list of different integers that add up to the integer
### Given a set of integers, find the highers integer possible arranging them.


## Divide and Conquer

### Binary Search
### Finding the majority in a vote
### Quick Sort (3-way partition)
### Merge Sort
### 2D Sort (Segments and Points Sorting problems)
